- [FizzBuzz.js][1] Section 2
- [HarmlessRansomNote.js][2] Section 3
- [isPalindrome.js][3] Section 4
- [ceaserChiper.js][4] Section 5
- [reverseWords.js][5] Section 6  
Wanted to avoid using for loops but it makes more cleaner solution.
- [reverseArrayInPlace.js][6] Section 7  
I tried to be funny with some array methods, but the solution given by the course was much cleaner.
- [meanMedianMode.js][7] Section 8  
The method to get mode is the longest one in the code. The one I made was almost identical to the one the course shows, except I didn't think the case where the set is from a uniform distribution. The course says there is no mode in this case.
- [twoSums.js][8] Section 9  
It's discouraging to try to make my best solution when I can't understand the question exactly.
- [binarySearch.js][9] Section 10
- [fibonacci.js][10] Section 11, 12  
Memoized method caches all the numbers found, and seems like using the cache anywhere in the stack.
- [sieveOfEratosthenes.js][11] Section 13
- [bubbleSort.js][12] Section 14
- [mergeSort.js][13] Section 15  
My code was working, but too messy.
- [maxStockProfit.js][14] Section 16  
This is discouraging.
